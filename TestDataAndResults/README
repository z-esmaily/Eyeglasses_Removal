Create with_glasses folder here for images with glasses
By default removed_by_prop folder will create for eyeglasses removal results (contains final eyeglasses removal images and generated eyeglasses masks and generated eyeglasses shadow masks)
(optional) Create JustImg folder (contains only final eyeglasses removal images here (not their masks). You need this, if you want to use create_fid library for fid or kid calculation)
(optional) Create noglasses folder (put without glasses images here. You need this, if you want to compare FID/KID between removal images and original no glasses images)
