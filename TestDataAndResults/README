Create with_glasses folder here for images with glasses
By default removed_by_prop folder will create for eyeglasses removal results (contains final eyeglasses removal images and generated eyeglasses masks and generated eyeglasses shadow masks)


(Optional) Create noglasses folder (put without glasses images here. You need this, if you want to compare FID/KID between removal images and original no glasses images)
Compute_FID_KID.ipynb computes FID/KID bettween two image folders. (If you use it, automatically "JustImg/removed_by_prop" folder will be created that only contains final eyeglasses removal images (not their masks)
